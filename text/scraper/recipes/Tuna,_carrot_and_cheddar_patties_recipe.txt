Ingredients
2 cans tuna in water, drained

1 egg, beaten
50g reduced-fat mature cheddar cheese, grated
1 tablespoons fresh parsley or coriander, chopped
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 handfuls lettuce leaves, to serve

Method
Preheat the oven to 200C (fan 180C, gas mark 6). Grease a large baking sheet with a little vegetable oil.
Put the tuna into a large mixing bowl and mash it with a fork. Add the carrots, onion, breadcrumbs, egg, cheese and fresh herbs. Season with some pepper.

For a vegetarian version, you can replace the tuna with a 150g of marinated tofu pieces, chopped finely.
Shape the mixture into 6 burger patties and arrange them on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then serve on the lettuce leaves.
Information:
If you're really hungry, serve the patties in warm pitta breads or lightly toasted burger buns.
