1g salt

Ingredients
1 large onion, chopped
8 carrots (about 500g), washed and chopped
1.2 litres reduced-salt vegetable stock
100g lower-fat soft cheese
1 pinch ground black pepper (optional)
small bunch of fresh coriander, chopped (optional)

Method
Put the onion and carrots into a large saucepan with the stock, and bring to a boil.
Information:
This recipe works well with more or less any root veg – so instead of carrots, try butternut squash, swede, sweet potato or parsnip.
Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
Blend the soup to a purée using a handheld stick blender – or transfer to a food processor or blender and whizz until smooth. Add most of the soft cheese and blend again until it is thoroughly mixed in.
Reheat gently, then serve, garnished with the remaining cheese, a little black pepper and some scattered coriander (if using). Enjoy with a slice of wholemeal bread.
Information:
Soup is the perfect meal for batch cooking and leftovers. Just cover, cool, refrigerate and eat within 3 days – or freeze for up to 2 months. Make sure you reheat it thoroughly before serving.
