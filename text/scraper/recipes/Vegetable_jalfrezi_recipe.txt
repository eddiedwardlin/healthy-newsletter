Ingredients
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1 medium apple, cored and chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 tablespoons jalfrezi curry paste
1 carrot, sliced
1 green pepper, deseeded and chopped
400g tomatoes, chopped
3 handfuls cauliflower, broken into florets
410g chickpeas in water, rinsed and drained
300ml reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock
180g easy cook long grain brown rice
50g fresh or frozen peas
2 tablespoons fresh coriander, chopped (optional)
4 tablespoons low-fat natural yoghurt, to serve
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Add the onions, apple and garlic and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the curry paste and cook for a few seconds.
Add the carrot, pepper, tomatoes, cauliflower, chickpeas and stock. Simmer, partially covered, for 25 to 30 minutes, adding a little extra stock or water if needed. At the same time, cook the rice in a large saucepan of gently boiling water. It will take about 30 minutes.
Information:
Use economy brands of canned tomatoes, chickpeas and lower-fat yoghurt to keep the cost of ingredients as low as possible.
Add the peas and coriander (if using) to the curry and heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Check the seasoning, adding a little ground black pepper if needed.
Serve the vegetable curry on warmed plates, with the rice, topping each portion with 1 tablespoon of low-fat yoghurt.
Information:
Cool any leftovers quickly and refrigerate, covered, for up to 3 days. Make sure you re-heat thoroughly before serving.
