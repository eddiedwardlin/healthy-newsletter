Ingredients
300g sweet potato, peeled and cut into small cubes
300g dried pasta shapes
100g peas (fresh or frozen)
2 tablespoons 1%-fat milk
150g low-fat natural yoghurt
40g reduced-fat hard cheese, grated
ground black pepper

Method
Cook the sweet potato chunks in simmering water for 12 to 15 minutes, until tender enough for a fork to easily pierce them. Drain well.
Information:
Butternut squash also works really well as an alternative to sweet potato.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large saucepan for 8 to 10 minutes, or according to pack instructions, until tender. Drain well, then return to the saucepan.
Stir the sweet potato chunks and peas through the pasta. Add the milk and yogurt and heat gently for 2 minutes, until all warmed through and slightly thickened. Serve, sprinkled with the cheese and a ground black pepper to taste.

This dish makes a great base for extra veg to help get your 5 A Day, so feel free to experiment. You could try adding chopped red pepper, sweetcorn or broccoli to cook with the sweet potato, for instance.
