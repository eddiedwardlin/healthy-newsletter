Ingredients
750g potatoes, scrubbed and cut into chunks
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 red apple, cored and cut into 1cm-thick slices
half a teaspoon caster sugar
400g pork fillet (tenderloin), sliced into chunks and fat trimmed
2 teaspoons dried mixed herbs
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
2 celery sticks, thinly sliced
150ml reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock
150ml unsweetened apple juice
1 pinch ground black pepper
4 tablespoons 1%-fat milk

Method
Cook the potatoes in simmering water, until tender. They will take about 20 minutes. Drain and put aside when cooked.
Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the apple slices, cooking them over a medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add the sugar and cook for another 1 or 2 minutes, until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Wipe the pan with kitchen paper.
Roll the pieces of pork fillet in the dried mixed herbs. Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan. Add the pork and cook over medium-heat for a few minutes to brown.
Information:
Another time, try this recipe with turkey breast steaks instead of pork.
Add the onion and celery, then pour in the stock and apple juice. Leave to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The liquid should reduce down a little. Season with pepper.
Mash the potatoes and beat in the milk.
Serve the potatoes with the pork and apples, along with a portion of lightly cooked fresh or frozen vegetables, like broccoli.
Information:
Pork fillet is delicious and quite economical. If you have any left over, try cutting it into strips or thin slices and stir-fry with lots of fresh vegetables, serving with rice or noodles.
