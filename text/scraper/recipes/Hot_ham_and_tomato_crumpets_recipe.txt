4 crumpets
4 tablespoons tomato purée
8 slices wafer thin ham
4 tomatoes, thinly sliced

Method
Preheat the grill and lightly toast the crumpets on both sides.
Information:
Use English muffins instead of crumpets - you'll need only 2, sliced in half.
Spread each crumpet with 1 teaspoon of tomato purée, then top with two slices of wafer-thin ham. Arrange the sliced tomatoes on top.
Information:
Sprinkle a few mixed dried herbs over the tomato purée before adding the ham, if you like.
Grill for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve at once.
