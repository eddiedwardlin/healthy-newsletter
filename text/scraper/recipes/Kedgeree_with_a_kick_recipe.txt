Ingredients
300g easy-cook white or brown rice
4 eggs
200g skinless cod fillet (or pollock), cut into chunks
120g skinless smoked haddock fillet, cut into chunks
120g skinless salmon fillet, cut into chunks
2 tsp curry powder
150g frozen peas, thawed
2 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Cook the rice in boiling water until tender, according to packet instructions. At the same time, hard-boil the eggs for 10 minutes.
Put the chunks of fish into a large frying pan and add a little water. Heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes until the fish is opaque. Drain.
Information:
Look out for ready-prepared plain fish pie mix from the fresh fish counter – also sold pre-packed – to save some money.
Shell the eggs and quarter them. Drain the rice and add it to the fish with the curry powder, peas and parsley. Heat, stirring gently, for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with black pepper and serve, topped with the eggs
Information:
Another time, use frozen mixed vegetables instead of peas.
