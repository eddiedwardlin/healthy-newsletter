Ingredients
Rosti
500g potato, grated
1 small onion, grated
1 courgette, coarsely grated
1 egg, beaten
Salsa
2 tomatoes, diced
4 tablespoons sweetcorn
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon red or white wine vinegar

Method
Preheat the oven to 220C (200C fan oven, gas mark 7) and find a medium-sized baking sheet.
Put the grated potato and courgette onto a thick layer of kitchen paper and press out as much water as you can, or squeeze over a sieve. Add to a bowl along with the onion and egg, and mix well to combine.
Information:
Desiree potatoes will work well for this recipe.
Take a large spoonful of the mixture and gently shape into a rough ball, then put on the baking sheet. Repeat to make 12 potato cakes. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, until crisp.
Meanwhile, make the salsa by mixing the tomatoes, sweetcorn, red onion, oil and vinegar.
Once the rosti are cooked, use a fish slice to lift them off the baking tray, and serve immediately with the salsa and a simple green salad.
Information:
The rosti make a great after-school snack, and work well cooled, wrapped in foil and popped in a lunchbox too.
