Ingredients
Quiches
1 teaspoon lower-fat spread to grease tin
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
100g button mushrooms, cut into quarters
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 eggs, beaten
50ml semi-skimmed milk
large pinch of black pepper
large pinch of nutmeg
10g reduced-fat cheddar, finely grated
To serve
quarter of an iceberg lettuce, shredded
half a green pepper, diced
1 celery stick, sliced
quarter of a cucumber, chopped
a few stems of fresh chives, chopped

Method
Grease the bottom and sides of 4 holes of a muffin tray. Cut 4 circles of baking paper and place in the bottom of each hole.
Heat the oil in a small frying pan, add the onions and cook for a couple of minutes until softened, then add the mushrooms and cook for a further few minutes. Transfer to the muffin tray.
Information:
Experiment with different vegetables – using 160g of thawed frozen vegetables instead of the mushrooms and onion saves time as there's no need to pre-cook them.
Mix the eggs with the milk, black pepper and nutmeg. Pour into the muffin tray and sprinkle on the cheese.
Bake in a preheated oven (180C, 160C fan, gas mark 4) for 15 minutes until risen and brown.
Leave in the tin to cool for 10 minutes. Remove by running a knife around the edge of the tin and then serve with the green salad.
Information:
Try them hot with some grilled tomatoes and toast for a delicious weekend brunch. These are also a good packed lunch option – just add some crusty bread.
