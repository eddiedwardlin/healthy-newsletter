Ingredients
100g wholemeal self-raising flour
1 teaspoon ground mixed spice
1 large egg
80g grated carrot
4 tablespoons low-fat, lower-sugar plain yoghurt
100ml semi-skimmed milk
30g sultanas or raisins
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

Method
Put the flour, mixed spice, egg, grated carrot, yoghurt and milk into a large mixing bowl and use a hand whisk or fork to mix together thoroughly.
Information:
You could use white self-raising flour, but wholemeal has more fibre.
Stir in the sultanas (or raisins).
Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a few drops of oil. Cook tablespoonfuls of the batter in batches, turning them over after 1 to 2 minutes to cook the other side.
Make 8 mini pancakes altogether, adding a further 2 to 3 drops of oil to the frying pan with each batch.

Keep in a food bag or airtight tin in a cool place for 2 to 3 days.
