2.4g fat, of which 0.7g saturates
5.5g sugar
0.0g salt

Ingredients
4 baking potatoes (each needs to be around 225g)
4 boneless, skinless uncooked chicken breasts
1 teaspoon dried oregano
8 tomatoes (ripe is best)
150g low-fat Greek-style natural yoghurt
4 spring onions, finely chopped
1 teaspoon red pesto (optional)

Method
Scrub the potatoes, then dry and prick each one several times with a sharp knife.
Information:
King Edward or Maris Piper potatoes would work best for this recipe.
Microwave Method: Cook one potato (225g) for 6 minutes on full power (800W), turn halfway through cooking. Allow to stand for 1 to 2 minutes before serving. If cooking more than one potato at a time you need to increase the cooking time accordingly.
Oven Method: Rub a few drops of olive oil into the potato skin, place the potatoes in a pre-heated oven at 200C (fan 180C, gas mark 6). Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until tender.
When the potatoes are almost ready, cut the chicken breasts into bite-size chunks, heat a non-stick frying pan and pan fry for about 6 to 8 minutes until lightly browned on both sides and cooked through. Add a pinch of dried oregano per person.
Information:
If you don't have dried oregano, rosemary or basil would also work well.
Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes into chunks, discarding the seeds. When the chicken is cooked, mix together the chicken, tomatoes, spring onions and the pot of yoghurt. Add pesto if you wish.
Serve the jacket potatoes with a portion of the chicken mixture and enjoy.
