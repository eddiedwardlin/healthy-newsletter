Ingredients
4 slices wholemeal bread, thickly sliced
4 tablespoons tomato purée
2 teaspoons dried mixed herbs
3 slices lean turkey ham, cut into thin strips
60g reduced-fat hard cheese, cut into thin strips
4 cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon sweetcorn (8 kernels are all you need)

Method
Preheat the grill.
Use a large biscuit cutter to cut out circles from the slices of bread. Toast these lightly on both sides.
Information:
If you don't have a large biscuit cutter, use an up-turned bowl to cut around for the bread circles.
Spread 1 teaspoon of tomato purée onto each piece of toast, then sprinkle with herbs. Overlap the strips of turkey ham and cheese on top, to look like bandages, leaving a small space to put the "eyes".
Information:
Use thin slices of roast chicken or turkey instead of ham.
Grill for 2 to 3 minutes to melt the cheese.
Put the halved tomatoes and sweetcorn on top of the faces, to look like "eyes". Eat while hot!
Information:
You could use white bread for this recipe, though wholemeal provides more fibre.
