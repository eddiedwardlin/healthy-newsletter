Ingredients
4 baking potatoes, scrubbed
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, peeled and sliced
1 red pepper, deseeded and cut into strips
1 yellow pepper, deseeded and cut into strips
3 teaspoons mild paprika
2 teaspoons dried oregano or mixed herbs
30g plain flour
1 pinch ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless uncooked chicken breasts
300ml reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock
500g (or one head) broccoli, broken into florets

Method
Preheat the oven to 190C (fan 170C, gas mark 5). Put the potatoes onto the top shelf of the oven to bake.
Information:
Try sweet potatoes instead of regular ones. Just bake them on the oven shelf above the casserole â€“ they will take about 45 minutes to cook.
Heat the vegetable oil in a flame-proof casserole dish and stir-fry the onion and peppers over a high heat until softened, about 3 minutes.
Put the paprika, herbs and flour into a shallow dish, and season with some pepper, stirring to mix. Dip each chicken breast into the mixture, coating them on both sides. Transfer them to the casserole dish, placing them on top of the onions and peppers.
Pour in the stock, then cover the dish. Put in the oven to cook once the potatoes have been baking for 30 minutes. Bake for 35 minutes.
Around 10 minutes before the chicken and potatoes are ready, cook the broccoli in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, drain and serve with the rest of the meal.
Information:
Try switching up the broccoli side with a serving of fresh or frozen green beans, peas or sweetcorn instead.
