Method
Preheat the oven to 180C, fan oven 160C, gas mark 4.
Put the frozen cherries and berries into a baking dish (there’s no need to thaw them).
Information:
Use any combination of frozen fruits, such as raspberries or fruits of the forest.
Put the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the lower-fat spread, rubbing it in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the porridge oats and sugar.
Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the fruit. Place the dish on a baking tray and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Serve with 2 tablespoons of yoghurt per person.
Information:
Try adding a few drops of vanilla extract to the yoghurt to add some more flavour.
