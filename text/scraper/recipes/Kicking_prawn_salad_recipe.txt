Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
juice of 1 lime
2 green chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
2 tablespoons fresh coriander (or parsley), finely chopped
200g peeled cooked prawns
1 romaine or cos lettuce
480g pre-cooked new potatoes, quartered
320g cherry tomatoes, halved
pinch of ground black pepper

Method
Make the dressing by mixing together the oil, lime, chillies and coriander or parsley in a salad bowl.
Information:
If you're not a fan of spice, simply leave the chilli out. Or if you like things particularly spicy, use red chillies instead!
Add the prawns and stir well to coat. If making ahead, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve (no more than few hours in advance).
When ready to serve, remove the prawns from the fridge. Add the potatoes and tomatoes, season with black pepper and mix well.
Information:
This works best with chopped large tomatoes, but cherry or mini plum tomatoes go well too.
Arrange the lettuce leaves on 4 serving plates. Spoon the prawn mixture onto each plate
