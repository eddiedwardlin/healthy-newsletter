Ingredients
350g butternut squash, peeled and cut into chunks
1 red pepper, deseeded and cut into chunks
1 yellow pepper, deseeded and cut into chunks
1 medium red onion, peeled and sliced
1 teaspoon olive oil
250g dried tagliatelle (or any long pasta, like spaghetti or linguine)
1 medium courgette
4 tablespoons reduced-fat green pesto sauce
4 teaspoons reduced-fat hard cheese, grated
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the oven to 200C (fan 180C, gas mark 6). Put the butternut squash, peppers and onion into a large roasting tin.
Information:
You can buy pre-prepared butternut squash, or peel and deseed a whole medium-sized one.
Add the olive oil to the pan and toss to coat the veg. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, turning once, until tender.
Around 10 minutes before the vegetables are ready, cook the tagliatelle in a large saucepan of boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
While the pasta is cooking, use a potato peeler to slice the courgette into long, thin strips. Add these to the tagliatelle to cook for about 3 minutes.
Drain the pasta and courgette, and return to the saucepan. Stir in the pesto sauce and roasted vegetables, along with any juices from the pan.
Season with black pepper and serve, sprinkling 1 teaspoon of grated cheese over each portion.
