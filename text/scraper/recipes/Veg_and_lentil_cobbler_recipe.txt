Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 celery sticks, sliced
1 medium parsnip, chopped
2 medium carrots, sliced
2 handfuls of cauliflower (about 10 florets)
2 handfuls cup or button mushrooms, sliced
1 tin chopped tomatoes
75g dried red lentils
2 tablespoons cornflour
450ml reduced-salt vegetable stock
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 pinch ground black pepper
150g self-raising flour
45g lower-fat spread
1 egg
30ml semi-skimmed milk

Method
Preheat the oven to 180C (fan 160C, gas mark 4). Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and cook the garlic and onion for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the celery, parsnip, carrots and cauliflower and stir-fry for 2 or 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat and add the mushrooms, tomatoes and lentils.
Information:
If you do not like some of the suggested vegetables, simply swap them with your favourites! Why not give broccoli, sweet potato or green beans a go?
Mix the cornflour with 3 to 4 tablespoons of water and add to the saucepan, along with the vegetable stock and parsley. Return to the heat and bring to the boil to thicken the mixture.
Season with pepper then transfer the mixture to a casserole dish. Cover and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, sift the flour into a large bowl and rub in the low-fat spread with your fingertips. Beat the egg and milk together in a separate bowl and add just enough to the dry mixture to make a soft dough. Knead lightly, then roll out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 2cm and cut into 4cm rounds.
Information:
When cutting out the rounds of dough, avoid twisting the cutter or the scones will not rise as much.
Remove the casserole from the oven and turn the temperature up to 200C (fan 180C, gas mark 6). Arrange the scones around the edge of the dish and brush with the remaining egg and milk.
Return to the oven uncovered and cook for a further 12 to 15 minutes, until the scone topping has risen and is golden brown.
