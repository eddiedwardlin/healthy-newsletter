6 spring onions, finely chopped
8 eggs
4 tablespoons 1%-fat milk
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the peppers and spring onions, and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes until soft. Tip them out of the pan into a bowl. Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper. Preheat the grill.
Information:
A really good non-stick frying pan is one of the most useful things to have in the kitchen!
Beat the eggs and milk together. Heat a few drops of vegetable oil in the non-stick frying pan and pour in one quarter of the egg mixture. Let it flow over the surface and cook for 1 to 2 minutes to set the base.
Sprinkle a quarter of the pepper mixture evenly over the surface, then grill for 1 to 2 minutes until set. Slide onto a warm plate.
Repeat with the remaining mixture to make 4 omelettes. Serve, seasoned with black pepper.

Serve each omelette with a slice of wholemeal toast for a more filling meal.
