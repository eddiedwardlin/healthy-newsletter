2 spring onions, finely chopped
2 tbsp low-fat natural yoghurt
4 wholemeal pitta breads
4 slices lean roast ham
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 handfuls cherry tomatoes
¼  of a cucumber, sliced
Add a seasonal twist
Some peeled and grated beetroot makes a great seasonal addition to the coleslaw!

Method
Mix together the cabbage, carrot and spring onions. Add the yoghurt and stir together. Season with black pepper.
Warm the pittas in a toaster or under the grill. Split them open and stuff each one with a slice of ham and the coleslaw.
Information:
For a vegetarian version, omit the ham and add 40g reduced-fat hard cheese to the coleslaw, either grated or cut into tiny cubes.
Serve each pitta with cherry tomatoes and cucumber.
Information:
Another time, use skinless roast turkey or chicken instead of ham.
