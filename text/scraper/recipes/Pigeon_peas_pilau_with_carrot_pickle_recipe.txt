2 cinnamon sticks (dalchini)
4 cloves

800ml (about 3 mugs) hot water

Swap tip
Eating too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, so it is best to reduce the amount you have. Try replacing the salt in this dish with paprika or lemon juice.

Method
Add all the ingredients for the pilau into a large non-stick pan. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and heat on high until the water comes to the boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium and cook, still covered, for 25 minutes.
Information:
Frozen pigeon peas are widely available in Asian and African Caribbean food stores.
Meanwhile make the carrot pickle by mixing all the ingredients together.
Gently stir the rice, turn the heat to very low and cook for a further 10 minutes until the water has been fully absorbed and the rice is fluffy.
Drizzle with lemon juice, if using, and serve with plain yogurt and carrot pickle.
