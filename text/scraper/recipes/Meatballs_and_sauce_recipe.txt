Method
Mix some of the chopped onion and garlic with the mince. Shape the mince into small balls about half the size of a golf ball.
Information:
Try using turkey mince as a lower-fat alternative to lamb.
Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and brown the meatballs on all sides. Remove and put on to a plate.
Add the remaining onion to the frying pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until soft. Add the remaining garlic and cook for another minute.
Add the tomatoes, tomato purée, herbs, mushrooms and peppers to the pan with 150ml water. Bring to the boil, then add the meatballs. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 30 minutes.
About 10 minutes before serving, put the pasta on to cook in plenty of boiling water. Serve with the meatballs and tomato sauce.
Information:
Serve with wholegrain brown rice as an alternative to pasta, but remember that it takes 25 to 30 minutes to cook.
