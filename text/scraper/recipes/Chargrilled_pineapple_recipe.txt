Ingredients
1 pineapple (or 1 tin of pineapple slices, in juice)
1 lime, cut into wedges
4 teaspoons desiccated coconut
4 tablespoons zero-fat Greek-style yoghurt (optional)

Method
Cut off the top and bottom of the pineapple, then remove the peel. Cut into 4 thick slices, and remove the core of each with a small knife.
Information:
Fresh pineapple is ideal for this dish but it works with tinned pineapple slices too. Allow 2 slices per person. You can also use ready-prepared fresh pineapple pieces, threaded on skewers.
Barbecue for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
Information:
You can cook these in a griddle pan on the hob or under a grill set on a high heat, too.
Serve each slice sprinkled with coconut and with a wedge of lime on the side. Add a spoonful of yoghurt if you like.
Information:
Try this with other fruits – barbecued mangoes, peaches, strawberries and bananas are all delicious!
