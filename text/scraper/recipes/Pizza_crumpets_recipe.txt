Ingredients
4 crumpets
4 tablespoons tomato purée
4 tomatoes, sliced
2 teaspoons dried mixed herbs
40g reduced-fat hard cheese, grated
1 pinch of ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the grill. Toast the undersides of the crumpets until crispy – about 2 minutes.
Information:
Try using wholemeal pitta breads as a change from crumpets. Just skip grilling the underside.
Remove from the grill, flip the crumpets over and spread each with 1 teaspoon of tomato purée. Arrange the sliced tomatoes on top and grill for 2 minutes.
Sprinkle the herbs and cheese evenly over the crumpets, season with pepper to taste, and grill until the cheese melts and bubbles – another minute or so. Serve at once.
Information:
Add a little chopped cooked ham, chopped cooked chicken or extra vegetables, such as sliced peppers, courgette or mushrooms on the crumpets before sprinkling with the cheese.
