Method
Blend the chopped tomatoes, ginger and green chillies together, and set aside for later.
Heat the oil in a non-stick pan on medium heat and cook the chopped onions for 5 minutes or so. Once softened and beginning to brown, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 3 minutes.
Add the blended tomato, ginger and chilli mix to the pan, along with the turmeric and frozen peas. Stir well and cook for a further 3 minutes.
Add the turkey mince to the pan along with the remaining spices. Mix well and keep cooking on a medium heat until the meat has turned white. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and carry on cooking for a few minutes to allow any excess water to evaporate. Once ready, top with chopped coriander.
