Ingredients
8 slices wholemeal bread
8 teaspoons lower-fat spread
1 small handful of watercress
120g skinless turkey breast, sliced
1 carrot, grated
1 apple, cored and grated
30g sultanas
3 tablespoons 0%-fat yoghurt
1 teaspoon fresh chives, chopped (optional)
1 pinch ground black pepper
To serve
1 handful cherry tomatoes
1 celery stick

Method
Spread the bread with lower-fat spread, add some watercress to 4 slices, then arrange the turkey on top.
Information:
Use skinless roast chicken breast instead of turkey, if you prefer.
Mix together the carrot, apple, sultanas or raisins and yoghurt. Pile on top of the turkey and sprinkle with chives (if using).
Information:
For a vegetarian version, use 60g grated reduced-fat hard cheese instead of turkey.
Sandwich together with the remaining slices of bread. Cut the sandwiches in half. If not eating straightaway, wrap in cling film and keep chilled until ready to eat, with the cherry tomatoes and celery.
Information:
Make a habit of having some salad or vegetable sticks with every sandwich you eat.
