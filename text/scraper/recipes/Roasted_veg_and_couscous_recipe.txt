Ingredients
1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped
1 yellow pepper, deseeded and chopped
2 courgettes, sliced
4 garlic gloves, removed from their skins but left whole
1 large red onion, sliced
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
300g couscous
450ml reduced-salt vegetable stock
250g cherry tomatoes
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the oven to 200C (fan oven 180C, gas mark 6). Put the pepper, courgette, garlic and onion into a roasting tin, and add the vegetable oil, tossing to coat. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring and turning after 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, put the couscous into a heatproof bowl and add the hot stock, stirring to mix. Cover and leave for 10 to 15 minutes to absorb the liquid and swell. Then stir with a fork to fluff up the grains.
Information:
If you fancy a change, the veg mixture also works well served over rice or stirred through pasta.
Remove the veg from the oven after about 30 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and cooked couscous, then season with some pepper and stir well to mix everything together.
Return everything to the oven for a further 5 minutes to heat through before serving.
Information:
If you're a fish lover, you could serve the couscous with grilled salmon or haddock fillets.
For a delicious veggie meal, try topping each portion with 25g of reduced-fat goats' cheese â€“ or stir through 150g of marinated tofu pieces with the couscous and cherry tomatoes, before returning to the oven to heat through.
