Ingredients
4 peppers, any colour, deseeded and cut in half
150g easy-cook long grain white rice
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 garlic glove, crushed
300g skinless turkey breasts, cut into chunks
2 tomatoes, chopped
75g frozen peas, thawed
1 teaspoon mild paprika
1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas mark 5. Arrange the peppers in a roasting pan, cut side up.
Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer, add the rice and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or according to pack instructions, until tender.
While the rice is cooking, heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok and stir-fry the onion and garlic for about 3 minutes, until softened. Add the turkey and stir-fry for about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, peas, paprika and herbs, then remove from the heat.
Information:
You can use skinless chicken breast instead of turkey. Or try vegetarian mince, or mushrooms and courgettes for a meatless version!
Drain the rice, stir it thoroughly into the tomato mixture and season with some pepper. Spoon the filling into the pepper halves – it's fine if there's too much, just spoon the rest into the roasting pan!
Information:
This can be made ahead of time – once you've stuffed the peppers, just cover the tray and pop in the fridge until you're ready to bake.
Cover with foil, bake for 20 to 25 minutes and then serve.
