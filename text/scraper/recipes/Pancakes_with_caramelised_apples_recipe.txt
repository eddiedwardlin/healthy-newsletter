21g carbohydrate of which sugars 6.5g
1g fibre
0.1g salt

Ingredients
75g plain flour
1 medium egg
200ml semi-skimmed or 1% fat milk
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 eating apple, cored and thinly sliced
1 teaspoon caster sugar
finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon

Method
Put the flour into a large jug or mixing bowl. Add the egg and milk and beat with a whisk or a handheld electric beater to make a smooth batter.
Information:
You could use half plain and half wholemeal flour for more fibre!
Heat a pancake pan or non-stick frying pan and add a few drops of vegetable oil. Pour in a quarter of the batter, tilting the pan so that it flows evenly over the surface. Cook over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until set, then flip over to cook the other side.
Information:
If you have time, leave the batter to stand for 10 minutes before cooking, and stir thoroughly before adding to the pan.
Make 4 pancakes in total, adding a few drops of oil to the pan for each one. Keep the pancakes in a warm place until they're all ready.
Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan and add the apple slices, cooking them over a medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, and turning often.
Sprinkle the sugar over the apples and cook for another few moments until lightly browned. Add the lemon zest and juice, stir to coat, then remove from the heat.
Information:
If you like, add a sliced banana to the frying pan with the lemon zest and juice, and mix with the apple before sharing between the pancakes.
Serve 1 pancake per person, topped with the caramelised apples.
