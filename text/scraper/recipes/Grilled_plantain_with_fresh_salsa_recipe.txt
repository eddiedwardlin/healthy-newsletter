Grilled plantain with fresh salsa recipe

A close relative of the banana, grilled ripe plantains are commonly eaten as a snack in many West African countries. They are naturally sweet, low in fat and are a good source of energy. They also make an excellent finger food for younger children.

Ingredients
2 ripe plantains
1 tomato, finely chopped
quarter of a cucumber, finely chopped
3 spring onions, finely chopped
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Peel plantains by chopping both ends off and making a slit along the whole length of each plantain skin. Slide your thumb under the slit to loosen and remove the skin.
Cut each plantain in half and then cut each piece lengthwise. (You should have 8 pieces altogether).
Grill on a low heat turning occasionally for about 10 minutes or until cooked. (Plantains are soft inside but not sticky when cooked).
Meanwhile, make the salsa by mixing together the tomato, cucumber and spring onion.
Information:
Make a fruity salsa by substituting 2 chopped pineapple rings in natural juice for the tomato.
Season with pepper, then serve with the warm plantain.
Information:
If you like things spicy, add a little finely chopped fresh red chili to the salsa, or use a pinch of chilli powder instead.
