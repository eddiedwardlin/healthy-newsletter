Ingredients
250g potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
400g chopped tomatoes
1 leek, sliced
1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs
3 handfuls (or 200g) cauliflower, broken into small florets
100g broccoli, broken into small florets
300g uncooked chicken breasts, cut into small chunks
200ml reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock
100g frozen mixed vegetables
150g uncooked shortcrust pastry
10g plain flour
4 tablespoons skimmed milk (to glaze)
2 teaspoons (8g) poppy seeds
8 frozen peas (to make the eyes)

Method
Cook the potatoes in gently boiling water until tender.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan and add the chicken, cooking for 3 to 4 minutes until sealed and browned.
Add the tomatoes, herbs, cauliflower, broccoli and stock. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender, adding an extra splash of water, if needed.
Information:
Use frozen broccoli and cauliflower instead, though cook for just 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the frozen mixed vegetables into the chicken mixture. Share between 4 large ramekin dishes or individual baking dishes and level the tops. Stand the dishes on a large baking sheet.
Information:
Try not to fill the dishes with too much liquid, or it could spill over the sides.
Drain the potatoes and mash them with two tablespoons of the milk.
Preheat the oven to 200C (fan oven 180C, gas mark 6). Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface. For each spider pie, cut out 8 strips for the legs, and 1 small circle for the head. Arrange on the pies and brush with milk. Place a scoop of mashed potato on top of each pie for the spider's body. Sprinkle with poppy seeds.
Information:
You could make one giant spider pie in a round baking dish.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, then serve with the peas placed on the spiders' heads to look like eyes.
