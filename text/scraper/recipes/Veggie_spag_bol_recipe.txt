Ingredients
300g frozen vegetarian mince
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 teaspoon red (or green) chopped chilli
2 celery sticks
1 carrot, chopped
1 aubergine, finely chopped
1 cube reduced-salt vegetable stock with 400ml boiled water
1 can chopped tomatoes
2 teaspoons dried Italian mixed herbs
2 tablespoons tomato purée
200g mushrooms, sliced
250g dried wholemeal spaghetti
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Heat a large heavy-based saucepan. Add in the frozen vegetarian mince, onion, garlic, chilli, celery, carrot, aubergine and vegetable stock. Bring to the boil.
Information:
Substitute different vegetables, such as peppers, leeks, courgette or fine green beans.
Add the tomatoes, dried herbs, tomato purée and mushrooms. Stir well. Simmer, partially covered, for 25 to 30 minutes, adding a little extra water if needed. Season with pepper.
Information:
Make a meat version with 300g extra-lean minced beef, dry-frying it in the saucepan until browned, then adding the rest of the ingredients.
About 15 minutes before you want to eat, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling water for 10 to 12 minutes, or according to pack instructions. Drain well, share between 4 warm plates and top with the Bolognese sauce.
Information:
Try reducing the quantity of spaghetti and pair it with cooked strips of carrot and courgette to add even more vegetables to it.
