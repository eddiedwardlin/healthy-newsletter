Ingredients
50g porridge oats
250g fresh or defrosted frozen raspberries
300g low-fat Greek-style natural yoghurt

Method
Preheat the grill. Sprinkle the porridge oats onto a baking sheet and spread them out evenly, then grill until they are light brown, about 2 or 3 minutes. Watch out to make sure they don't burn!
Once toasted, set the baking sheet aside and let the oats cool down.
While the oats cool, put half the raspberries into a mixing bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to squash them down slightly. Divide the rest of the whole raspberries between 4 serving glasses, saving 4 raspberries for decoration.
Information:
You can use forest fruits, strawberries or mixed summer berries (defrosted if frozen) instead of raspberries.
Add the yoghurt and cooled oats to the bowl of crushed raspberries, and stir gently together.
Information:
Ordinary low-fat yoghurt works fine if you don't have any Greek-style.
Spoon the raspberry mixture into the serving glasses and top each one with a whole raspberry. Cover and chill until you're ready to serve.
