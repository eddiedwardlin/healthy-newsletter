Ingredients
1 large onion, chopped
4 carrots, chopped
1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped
900ml reduced-salt vegetable stock
50g dried red lentils
quarter teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
4 tablespoons low-fat natural yoghurt
pinch of ground black pepper
To serve
2 teaspoons fresh chives (optional)
4 wholemeal bread rolls (optional)

Method
Put the carrots, onion, red pepper, lentils and ginger (if using) into a large saucepan. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes, until the vegetables and lentils are tender.
Information:
To make the soup even more economical, use 500g of carrots and leave out the red pepper. In general, soup is a great way to use up any old or leftover veg, like potatoes, tomatoes, sweet potato or butternut squash.
Blend the soup using a hand-held stick blender, or a liquidiser or food processor if you have one. Season to taste with pepper.
Ladle the soup into 4 bowls and swirl the yoghurt on top. Garnish with some extra black pepper and chopped chives (if using), and serve with wholemeal rolls, if you like.
Information:
Cool the soup and store in a covered container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
