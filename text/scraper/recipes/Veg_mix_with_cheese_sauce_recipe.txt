1 cauliflower, broken into florets
200g broccoli, broken into florets
4 carrots, sliced
200g sugar snap peas or green beans, trimmed
2 courgettes, sliced
20g lower-fat spread
6 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
40g plain flour
300ml or 1%-fat or semi-skimmed milk
50g reduced-fat mature cheddar cheese, grated
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Put the cauliflower, broccoli and carrots in a steamer or colander positioned over a large saucepan of steadily boiling water. Steam for 5 to 6 minutes.
Add the sugar snap peas or green beans, and courgettes. Steam for about 5 more minutes, until the vegetables are cooked, yet still retain a little crunchiness.
Information:
Steaming is a healthier way of cooking fresh vegetables, so try to use this method more often. Alternatively, the vegetables can be cooked in a small amount of boiling water until tender.
After the second batch of vegetables goes in, start making the sauce. Melt the low-fat spread in a saucepan and add the spring onions. Cook gently for 2 to 3 minutes to soften them.
Stir in the flour and cook gently over a low heat for a further minute, then remove from the heat.
Gradually add the milk, stirring until it is mixed in. Return to the heat and bring up to the boil, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.
Add the cheese to the sauce and stir over a low heat until melted. Season with some pepper.
Pour the sauce over the vegetables and serve at once.
