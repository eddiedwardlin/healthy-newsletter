Ingredients
4 uncooked skinless, boneless chicken breasts
4 spring onions, trimmed and sliced
1 carrot, cut into matchstick strips
1 courgette, cut into matchstick strips
1 teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoon reduced-salt soy sauce
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Cut 4 pieces of greaseproof paper or baking parchment, each measuring approximately 30cm square. Put each chicken breast onto a separate square of greaseproof paper.
Mix the vegetables together and place an equal amount on top of each piece of chicken. Sprinkle with 5-spice powder (if using), the ginger, soy sauce and black pepper.
Fold up the paper to wrap up the chicken completely. Put the parcels into a steamer, cover and steam for 35 to 40 minutes.
Check that the chicken is properly cooked by unwrapping one of the parcels and inserting a sharp knife into the thickest part. The juices should run clear with no traces of pink.
Information:
It's important when steaming to make sure the water never boils dry. Check from time to time and top up with extra boiling water if needed.
Serve the chicken in the parcels, along with vegetables and noodles, rice or potatoes.
