Ingredients
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
160g popping corn
1 teaspoon piri-piri seasoning (or cayenne pepper)
100g ready-prepared fresh pomegranate seeds
freshly ground black pepper

Method
Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Add the popping corn, put the lid on, and shake the pan to coat the kernels in the oil.
Put the pan over a medium-high heat. The kernels will begin to pop â€“ when they do, carefully shake the pan occasionally.
When the popping has almost stopped, remove from the heat. Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then add the piri-piri seasoning, pomegranate seeds and a little black pepper, stirring them through. Share between 4 small bowls and serve.
Information:
Try your own seasonings, such as lightly toasted cumin and sesame seeds. For a fruitier version, leave out the piri-piri and add chopped apple, blueberries, seedless grapes and a pinch of ground cinnamon.
