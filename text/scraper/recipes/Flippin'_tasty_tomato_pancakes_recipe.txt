Ingredients
100g plain flour
1 egg
3 tablespoons lower-fat natural yoghurt
250ml 1%-fat milk
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
200g closed-cup mushrooms, sliced
50ml reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock
2 handfuls cherry tomatoes, halved
1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Put the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the egg, yoghurt and milk. Use a wire whisk or handheld electric beater on a slow speed to whisk the ingredients together to make a smooth batter.
Information:
The batter can be made in a blender if you prefer. Just whizz all the ingredients together for 15 to 20 seconds.
Heat a few drops of vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add one quarter of the batter, tilting the pan so that the batter flows over the surface. Cook until bubbles appear and the batter has set, then flip over to cook the other side. Repeat to make 4 pancakes, keeping them in a warm place.
Meanwhile, put the mushrooms and stock into a large frying pan and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and herbs and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.
Serve 1 pancake per person, topped with the mushrooms and tomatoes.
Information:
For a sweet version, serve 1 pancake per person, topped with a sliced banana and an extra tablespoon of low-fat natural yoghurt.
