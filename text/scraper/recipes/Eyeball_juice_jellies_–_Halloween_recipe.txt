Ingredients
12 fresh lychees (or large black grapes)
12 green seedless grapes
12 fresh blueberries
1 sachet powdered gelatine
250ml unsweetened apple and raspberry fruit juice
250ml cold water

Method
If using lychees, peel off the skin and remove the stones. If using black grapes, split them, without cutting right through. Push a green grape into each lychee or black grape, then push a blueberry into each one, so that the fruits look like eyeballs.
Information:
You could use melon balls instead of green grapes for the "eyeballs".
Put one "eyeball" into each of 4 serving glasses. Cover the remaining "eyeballs" and keep them chilled.
Pour 90ml of just-boiled water into a measuring jug and sprinkle in the powdered gelatine, stirring to mix it in. Leave for about 5 minutes, so that it dissolves into a clear liquid.
Mix the apple and raspberry juice and cold water into a large jug. Pour in the cooled gelatine liquid, stirring well.
Information:
Make sure you choose pure 100% fruit juice and not a "juice drink", which has added sugar. You could use 100% apple juice as an alternative.
Share between the glasses and refrigerate until set. This should take about 2 to 3 hours.
Serve, decorated with the remaining "eyeballs". Scary!!
