Ingredients
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 boneless salmon fillets
75g breadcrumbs
2 teaspoons green pesto
2 teaspoons parmesan cheese, grated (or any lower-fat hard cheese)
1 teaspoon lower-fat spread
3 medium courgettes, sliced
2 medium red onions, chopped
3 medium carrots, chopped
600g new potatoes

Method
Preheat oven to 200C (180C fan, gas mark 6). Add all the vegetables (except the potatoes) to a roasting tray. Drizzle over the oil, season with black pepper and mix well to fully coat. Cook in the oven for 30 minutes, or are until the vegetables are soft and just beginning to brown.
Information:
You can use any veg you fancy for this recipe. You will need about 160g per person.
While the vegetables are roasting, line a baking tray with non-stick baking parchment, and arrange the salmon fillets on it. In a bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, pesto, cheese and lower-fat spread. Spoon the mixture evenly over the salmon pieces and press down lightly.
Once the vegetables have been cooking for 15 minutes, remove and stir to prevent sticking or burning. Return to the oven, along with the salmon, and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the fish is cooked through.
When the fish goes in the oven, cook the potatoes in boiling water for 15 minutes or until soft. Serve with the salmon and oven-roasted mixed vegetables.
