Ingredients
250g pasta (any shape)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
5 spring onions, trimmed and chopped
100g sugar-snap peas or green beans, sliced
200g broccoli, broken into small florets
1 pepper (any colour), deseeded and chopped
75g peas (defrosted, if frozen)
3 handfuls cherry tomatoes, halved
200g lower-fat soft cheese with garlic and herbs
50ml semi-skimmed milk
zest of 1 lemon

Method
Cook the pasta in boiling water for 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the instructions on the packet, until just tender.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan or wok. Add the spring onions, sugar-snap peas or green beans, broccoli and pepper, and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened. Stir in the peas and tomatoes, then remove from the heat.
Drain the cooked pasta but keep 2 tablespoons of the cooking water. Add this water back to the saucepan, along with the cheese, milk and lemon zest. Heat, stirring with a whisk, until the sauce is hot and smooth.
Information:
Use plain low-fat soft cheese if anyone does not like garlic.
Tip the pasta and cooked vegetables into the sauce, and stir gently for a minute or so to heat through. Divide among 4 bowls and enjoy!
Information:
Finish off each portion with 2 teaspoons of finely grated reduced-fat cheese, if you like.
