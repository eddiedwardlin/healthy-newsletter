Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 red chilli, finely chopped
350g salad potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 2cm cubes
1 pinch of ground black pepper

400g chopped tomatoes (fresh or tinned)
2 tablespoons fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Heat the oil in a saucepan, then add the cumin, ground coriander and onion. Fry on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent the spices from sticking.
Add the chilli and potatoes, season with pepper to taste, and cook for a few more minutes.

Feel free to leave out the chilli if you're not a fan of spicy food.
Add the water, cover the pan and cook on high for 8 to 10 minutes.
Tip in the tomatoes and cook uncovered for another 5 to 7 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
Remove from the heat and stir in the fresh coriander just before serving.

Serve as a side as part of a larger meal, or with a salad for a tasty lunch.
