6g fibre
1.7g salt

Ingredients
4 lean back bacon rashers, fat trimmed
8 tomatoes, halved
250g closed-cup mushrooms, washed and thickly sliced
50ml cold water
420g reduced-salt and sugar baked beans in tomato sauce
1 tsp vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the grill. Arrange the bacon and halved tomatoes on the rack and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, turning the bacon once.
Meanwhile, put the mushrooms into a large frying pan with the water. Heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Information:
Cooking mushrooms in a little water is a much healthier cooking method than frying them.
At the same time, heat the baked beans in a separate saucepan.
Information:
Make it a habit to choose canned beans with a reduced sugar and salt content.
Heat the vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan and crack in the eggs. Cook over a medium heat for about 2 minutes until set, then transfer to the grill to set the surface. At this point, remove the grill pan, and share the bacon and tomatoes between 4 warm serving plates.
Share out the baked beans and mushrooms, then place 1 egg on each plate. Season with black pepper and serve.
