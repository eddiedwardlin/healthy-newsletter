Ingredients
Burgers
1 small onion, quartered
small can (about 210g) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
250g lean beef mince
wholemeal breadcrumbs (from 1 slice of bread)
2 teaspoons mild chilli powder, or to taste
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon tomato purée
To serve
1 extra large tomato, sliced
1 red onion, sliced
lettuce leaves
4 wholemeal rolls

Method
Chop the onion in a food processor, then add the beans, mince, breadcrumbs, chilli powder, beaten egg and tomato purée, and mix again.
Information:
If you prefer a chunkier texture, mash the beans with a fork or potato masher, chop the onions by hand and then mix with the other ingredients.
Shape the mixture into 4 patties and chill until you're ready to cook.
Barbecue or grill for 5 to 7 minutes each side.
Serve in the rolls, with sliced onion and tomato, and lettuce leaves.

Serve with corn on the cob for a complete meal.
