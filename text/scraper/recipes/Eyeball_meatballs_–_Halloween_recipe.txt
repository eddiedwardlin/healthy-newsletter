Ingredients
400g lean minced turkey breast
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, grated
2 teaspoons dried mixed herbs
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
400g chopped tomatoes
Half a stock cube (reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock), with 150ml boiled water
1 pinch ground black pepper
200g green tagliatelle or spaghetti
8 reduced-fat mini mozzarella balls
8 cherry tomatoes, halved
1 tablespoon fresh basil, to garnish

Method
Mix together the minced turkey with half the chopped onion, all the carrot and mixed herbs. Season with black pepper.
Information:
You can also use extra-lean pork mince or extra lean minced beef to make the meatballs.
Form the mixture into 8 meatballs, using wet hands to prevent the mixture from sticking to them.
Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan, then add the meatballs. Fry gently, turning occasionally, until lightly browned.
Information:
Stir the meatballs gently so that they don't break up.
Separately mix the stock cube in water, stiring until dissolved. Then add the remaining onion, tomatoes and the stock. Season with black pepper. Heat until boiling, then reduce the heat and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, cook the tagliatelle for 10 to 12 minutes in gently boiling water.
Share the tagliatelle between 4 serving plates and serve with the meatballs and sauce. Top each meatball with a mozzarella letting it melt for a few moments, then press the cherry tomatoes on top, to look like eyeballs.
Information:
Use small radishes, cut in half, instead of cherry tomatoes.
Garnish with basil leaves, then serve.
