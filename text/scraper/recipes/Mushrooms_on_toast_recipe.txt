Ingredients
4 handfuls of cup or button mushrooms, washed and sliced
300ml semi-skimmed milk
4 slices wholemeal bread
4 teaspoons lower-fat spread
4 tablespoons cornflour

Method
Put the mushrooms and milk into a saucepan, and heat until just boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile toast the bread. Spread each slice with lower-fat spread.
Mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of cold water, then stir the mixture into the mushrooms. Heat until it thickens (this takes only a few seconds) and cook gently for 1 minute.
Information:
Another time, use the mushroom mixture as a delicious filling for omelettes.
Divide the mushrooms evenly between the slices of toast and serve straight away.
Information:
You can use regular or mini pitta breads instead of toast if you prefer. Warm the pittas first and stuff them with some shredded lettuce before spooning in the mushrooms.
