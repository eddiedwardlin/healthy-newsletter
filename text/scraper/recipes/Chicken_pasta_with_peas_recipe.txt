Method
Bring a large pan of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and the pasta. Stir once and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the instructions on the packet, until the pasta is cooked but still slightly firm in the middle.

Add extra vegetables if you like, such as chopped red pepper and sweetcorn.
Put the pan back over a low heat and mix gently until everything is just warmed through. Divide evenly between 4 bowls and tuck in!
