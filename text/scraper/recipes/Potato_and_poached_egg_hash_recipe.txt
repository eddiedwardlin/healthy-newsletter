Ingredients
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 rashers lean back bacon, chopped
400g potatoes, pre-cooked and cut into chunks
4 spring onions, finely chopped
4 tomatoes, chopped
4 eggs
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Heat the vegetable oil in a large non-stick frying pan and add the bacon, cooking it for 1 to 2 minutes. Tip in the potatoes and cook over a medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until browned.
Information:
New potatoes or charlotte potatoes are ideal for this recipe, as they don't break up. If using cold potatoes, take care when stirring â€” and avoid stirring too often to help them keep their shape.
Add the spring onions and tomatoes, and cook over a low heat for another 4 to 5 minutes, while poaching the eggs.
Poach the eggs in simmering water for 3 to 4 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks still runny (or longer if you prefer a firm set).
Information:
Add a few drops of vinegar to the poaching water to help keep the eggs together.
Share the potato hash between 4 warm serving plates and place a poached egg on top. Season with black pepper, then serve.
Information:
For a vegetarian version, swap the bacon for 2 tablespoons of drained canned red kidney beans, packed in water.
