Ingredients
0.5 teaspoon vegetable oil

1 pinch ground black pepper
40g reduced-fat mature cheddar cheese, grated

Method
Preheat the grill to medium-high. Grease a baking sheet with the vegetable oil.
Arrange the fish fillets on the baking sheet and spread 1 tablespoon of the tomato purée over each one. Top with the tomatoes, season with a little pepper and scatter the grated cheese on top.
Grill for 6 to 8 minutes, until the fish is cooked. The flesh should flake easily when tested with a fork. Serve with fresh green vegetables, and cooked rice or boiled potatoes.

Cod, pollock, coley or sea bass fillets all work well for this recipe too.
