Ingredients
240g lean braising steak, cut into chunks
2 medium onions, chopped
1 pepper (any colour), deseeded and chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 teaspoons curry powder
2 tins chopped tomatoes
2 tablespoons mango chutney
2 tablespoons tomato purée
300ml water
200g easy-cook long grain white rice

Method
Brown the beef in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole dish over a low heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Information:
For a vegetarian version, use soya chunks instead of beef.
Add the peppers, carrots and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often to stop it from sticking, adding a little water if necessary.
Add the curry powder and stir well to mix, then add the tomatoes, mango chutney, 300ml water and the tomato purée. Cover and simmer gently for between 90 minutes and 2 hours, or until the meat is tender, adding more water if necessary.
Information:
For extra heat, add a generous pinch of dried chilli flakes along with the curry powder.
About 15 minutes before serving, cook the rice according to packet instructions. Serve with the curry.
Information:
You could make this in a slow cooker, transferring it at step 3 – though you will not need the 300ml water.
