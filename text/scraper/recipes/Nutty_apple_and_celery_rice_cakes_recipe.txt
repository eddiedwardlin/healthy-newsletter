Ingredients
4 rice cakes
100g reduced-fat soft cheese
1 small red apple, quartered and cored
1 small celery stick, sliced into 4 pieces
8 hazelnuts
4 seedless red grapes, halved

Method
Spread each rice cake with a quarter of the soft cheese.
Next, cut each apple quarter into 3 slices, and place on the rice cakes – 2 pieces to represent eyebrows, and 1 to represent the mouth.
Position the celery on each rice cake for the noses, with a hazelnut placed on each side for the nostrils. Finally, place the halved grapes under the eyebrows to look like eyes.
Information:
Use sultanas or raisins instead of hazelnuts for the nostrils, and a halved dried apricot instead of grapes for the eyes.
