100g wholemeal self-raising flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon mixed dried herbs
75g porridge oats

Method

Information:
The secret to successful muffins is to avoid over-mixing the wet and dry ingredients.
In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, dried herbs and porridge oats.
Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, taking care that you do not over-mix. Spoon into the muffin cases and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until firm and golden. Cool on a wire rack.
Information:
Freeze some of the muffins in a freezer bag or box – they will keep for up to 3 months.
