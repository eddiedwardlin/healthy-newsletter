2 teaspoons tomato purée

Swap tip
Don't worry if you don't have all the ingredients – you can just stick to the jacket with tuna and beans for a simple dinner fave.

Method
Preheat the oven to 200C (fan 180C, gas mark 6). Prick the potatoes, then bake towards the top of the oven for 1 hour, or until tender.
While the potatoes are cooking, mix together the cannellini beans, tuna, pepper, tomatoes, spring onions, vinegar and tomato purée. Season with black pepper.
Information:
For a vegetarian option, use 200g tofu instead of the tuna.
Split the baked potatoes open and fill them with the salsa mixture. Serve at once.
Information:
Remember to eat the skin of the potato, as it's high in fibre.
