Swap tip
This is a great recipe for swapping ingredients. You can replace the toppings with any fresh, frozen or tinned veg. Try adding chopped tinned pineapple for a Hawaiian twist.

Method
Preheat the grill. Arrange the peppers and mushrooms on a baking sheet and grill them for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once. Add the tomatoes and herbs, then season with black pepper. Keep warm.
Information:
Add some torn-up basil leaves to the tomato mixture for extra flavour.
Put a tortilla into a dry frying pan and sprinkle a quarter of the cheese over the top. Cook over a medium heat for about 30 to 40 seconds until melted.
Information:
You could use white flour tortillas, though they won't provide as much fibre as wholewheat ones.
Add a quarter of the vegetable mixture to one side of the tortilla, then fold it in half, over the filling. Cook for a few moments, then slide it onto a warm serving plate. Keep warm.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Serve with the salad leaves, grated carrot and celery.
Information:
For a snack, just make 2 and cut them in half to serve 4 people.
