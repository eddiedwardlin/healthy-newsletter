1.9g salt

Ingredients
25g lower-fat spread
2 shallots (or half a red onion), finely chopped
2.5cm (about 5g) fresh root ginger, peeled and grated
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 teaspoon reduced-salt soy sauce
2 tablespoons mango chutney
zest and juice of 2 limes
1 teaspoon sweet chilli sauce
500g firm white fish fillets (like cod, pollock or haddock), cut into chunks
1 pepper (any colour), deseeded and cut into small chunks
225g easy-cook long grain white rice
4 handfuls mixed salad leaves
quarter of a cucumber, chopped
4 tablespoons low-fat salad dressing

Method
Melt the low-fat spread in a small saucepan over a medium heat, and add the shallots, ginger and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft but not browned.
Remove the pan from the heat, then add the soy sauce, mango chutney, lime zest, lime juice and sweet chilli sauce. Stir until well mixed.
Set the grill to medium-high to preheat. Thread the fish and pepper onto small skewers, then brush with the sauce.
Information:
If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in cold water for 20 minutes beforehand to stop them burning under the grill.
Cook under the grill, brushing with the remaining sauce and turning frequently, until golden brown on the outside and cooked through – about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions, and mix together the salad ingredients.
When the fish is cooked, serve with the rice and the mixed green salad.
Information:
This also works well served over couscous.
