40g lower-fat spread, melted

Method
Preheat the oven to 200C (fan 180C, gas mark 6). Put 12 paper cases into a bun tray.
Sift the flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl, then stir in the sugar.
Information:
If you like, add half a teaspoon of ground mixed spice or ground cinnamon to the flour and sugar mixture.
Put the milk, egg, vanilla extract and melted spread in a jug and beat together with a whisk. Add the wet mix to the dry ingredients, then add the apple and mashed banana. Stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
Spoon the mixture into the paper cases and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the muffins have risen and turned golden. Carefully remove the muffins in their paper cases from the bun try, and leave to cool on a wire rack.
Information:
To freeze, make sure the muffins have completely cooled then pop them in a freezer bag. Make sure to squeeze out as much air from the bag as possible!
