Ingredients
2 oranges
600ml semi-skimmed milk
80g ground rice
quarter teaspoon ground mixed spice
60g sultanas or raisins

Method
Finely grate 1 teaspoon of zest from 1 of the oranges, then squeeze the juice from the orange. Slice the second orange into segments, removing all the peel and pith.
Put the milk, ground rice, orange zest and mixed spice into a non-stick saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until thickened.
Add the orange juice and most of the sultanas or raisins, then cook over a very low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring all the time.
Information:
Try using ground nutmeg instead of mixed spice.
Share the pudding between 4 bowls, and top with the orange segments and remaining sultanas. Serve at once.
Information:
This makes a delicious breakfast dish instead of porridge.
