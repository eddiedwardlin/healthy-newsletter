Ingredients
4 slices wholemeal bread
80g lower-fat soft cheese
half a teaspoon vanilla extract
2 peaches, pitted and thinly sliced
4 plums, pitted and thinly sliced
4 tablespoons half-fat crème fraîche
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Method
Preheat the grill. Lightly toast the slices of bread on both sides.
Information:
Always try to choose wholemeal bread over white, as it provides the body with more fibre.
Mix the soft cheese and vanilla extract together, then spread it on the toast. Top with the plums, and sliced peaches or nectarines.
Return to the grill for 3 to 4 minutes.
Top each portion with 1 tablespoon of the crème fraîche, sprinkle with a little ground nutmeg and serve.
Information:
Try to include fresh fruit for breakfast most days of the week.
