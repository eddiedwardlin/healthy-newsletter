Ingredients
Topping
4 spring onions, chopped
400g chopped tomatoes
2 tablespoons tomato purée
2 teaspoons dried mixed herbs
4 reduced-fat mini naan breads
150g skinless, boneless roast chicken breast, sliced
50g grated reduced-fat hard cheese
Salad
12 cherry tomatoes, quartered
quarter of a cucumber, finely chopped
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon green chilli, finely chopped (optional)
1 tablespoon fresh coriander, chopped

Method
Preheat the oven to 200C (180C fan, gas mark 6).
Put the spring onions, tomatoes, tomato purée and mixed herbs into a saucepan over a medium heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring often, until reduced and thickened.
Arrange the naan on a baking sheet, divide the tomato mixture between them equally. Add the chicken, then sprinkle over the cheese. Bake for 5 to 6 minutes.
Information:
For a vegetarian version, just leave out the chicken.
Meanwhile, mix together the salad ingredients, and serve with the naan once ready.
Information:
Be sure to choose the healthier version of naan breads to keep the fat content lower.
