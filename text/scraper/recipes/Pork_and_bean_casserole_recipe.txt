Ingredients
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
350g lean pork shoulder, cut into chunks
1 large onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 carrots, sliced
1 unpeeled medium apple, cored and chopped
400g chopped tomatoes
2 tins haricot or cannellini beans in water, rinsed and drained
300ml reduced-salt vegetable or chicken stock
2 tablespoons tomato purée
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons dried mixed herbs
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Method
Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan, gas mark 4).
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large flameproof casserole dish. Add the chunks of pork, cooking them over a high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until seared and browned.
Information:
This casserole also works really well with chunks of turkey or chicken breast instead of pork.
Add the onion, garlic, carrots and apple. Cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes.
Add the tomatoes, beans, tomato purée, worcestershire sauce, mixed herbs and stock. Season with some pepper and stir well to mix. Put the lid on and transfer to the oven to cook for 90 minutes. Serve, sprinkled with the chopped parsley.
Information:
Why not serve with some jacket potatoes? Just scrub some even-sized large potatoes and bake them on the shelf above the casserole for the final hour.
