Ingredients
1 tablespoon low-fat plain yoghurt
¼ teaspoon of mild curry powder, to taste
85g cooked chicken, chopped
2 slices of wholemeal bread
1 small wedge of lettuce, shredded
1 small carrot, grated
1 small piece of cucumber, sliced

Method
Mix the yoghurt and curry powder to taste, then add the chicken.
Information:
For a non-spicy alternative, just swap reduced-fat mayonnaise for the curry powder and yoghurt.
Fill the sandwich with the chicken mixture, lettuce and carrot.
Cut into quarters and serve with the cucumber on the side.
Information:
This also works brilliantly in a wholemeal wrap or pitta!
