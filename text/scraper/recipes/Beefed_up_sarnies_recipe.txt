Ingredients
1 carrot, grated
1 cooked beetroot (vacuum packed), grated

8 teaspoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
1 handful mixed salad leaves
4 slices lean roast beef (fat trimmed off)
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
In a bowl, mix together the carrot, beetroot and red onion with the vinegar. Season with black pepper.
Information:
Use a couple of finely sliced spring onions instead of red onion, if you prefer.
Spread each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon of mayonnaise, then top 4 of them with the lettuce leaves and the roast beef. Share the salad between them, then sandwich together with the remaining slices of bread.
Cut in half and serve at once, or wrap and keep cool to serve later.
Information:
You could also use lean roast pork or ham instead of beef.
