Ingredients
2 reduced-fat sausages
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
400g chopped tomatoes (fresh or tinned) or passata
410g tin cannellini or butter beans in water, drained
100g potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
2 teaspoons dried basil or dried mixed herbs
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the grill to medium-high. Grill the sausages for 8 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until they're thoroughly cooked.
While the sausages are cooking, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 2 or 3 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, beans, potatoes and basil or mixed herbs. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are tender.
Information:
Boost your 5 A Day by adding chopped courgette or other veg – like carrot, sweet potato or pepper – at the same time as the potato.
Slice the sausages and add them to the saucepan. Stir and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes to make sure they're warmed through. Serve in bowls and tuck in!
