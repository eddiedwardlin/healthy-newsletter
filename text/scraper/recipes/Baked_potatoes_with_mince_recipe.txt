Baked potatoes with mince recipe

An easy, filling, low-cost meal that kids will love. Potatoes last a while and the mince freezes well – so serve it often! You can cut the cooking time by using a microwave, too.

Ingredients
4 baking potato, scrubbed clean
250g extra-lean minced beef
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 handful cup or button mushrooms, finely chopped
100ml reduced-salt vegetable stock
1 teapsoon tomato purée
Side salad
1 handful shredded lettuce leaves
1 medium red onion, sliced
1 handful cherry tomatoes

Method
Preheat the oven to 200°C, fan 180°C, gas mark 6. Prick potatoes all over with a fork before baking for 1 hour, or until tender. Carefully push a sharp knife into the centre to check they're soft.
Information:
If you have a microwave, you can save time (and money) by cooking the potatoes in there instead. Put the pricked potatoes on a microwave-safe plate and cook on full power for 4 minutes. Turn them over and repeat for a further 4 minutes, or until cooked through.
Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan and add the mince, a handful at a time, cooking until browned.
Information:
You can use any type of mince you like for this – pork or turkey work well, as does vegetarian mince.
Add the onion and garlic, cook for 1 minute, then add the mushrooms, stock and tomato purée. Stir well until hot, then simmer, part-covered, for 20 to 25 minutes.
Once everything's ready, split the baked potatoes open and divide the filling between them. Serve with some watercress, or the lettuce, onion and tomato side salad.
Information:
Any leftover mince goes great in a wrap, topped with a spoon of low-fat plain natural yoghurt and a grating of lower-fat cheese. Let it cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge, and use within 3 days. It also freezes brilliantly!
