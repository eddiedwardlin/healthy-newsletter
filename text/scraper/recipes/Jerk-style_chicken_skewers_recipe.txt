Ingredients
Chicken skewers
4 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes
1 clove garlic, crushed
juice of half a lemon
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 or 2 teaspoons jerk seasoning, to taste
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 12 large chunks
1 red pepper, cut into 16 chunks
1 onion, quartered and separated to give 16 pieces
To serve
4 sweetcorn cobettes

Method
Mix the garlic, lemon juice and olive oil with 1 teaspoon of jerk seasoning (or 2 if you prefer a spicier flavour). Stir in the chicken and set aside while you prepare the vegetables.
Thread a piece of pepper onto a skewer, then onion, then chicken, finishing with onion.

Try other vegetables like mushrooms and courgettes – or even fruit like mango or pineapple.
Cook on the barbecue for 8 to 10 minutes, turning frequently. Alternatively, cook under a preheated grill.
Meanwhile cook the sweetcorn cobettes in boiling water, or on the barbecue for 6 to 8 minutes.
