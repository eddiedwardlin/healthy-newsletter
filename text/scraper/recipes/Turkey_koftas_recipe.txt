Ingredients
Koftas
8 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes
half an onion, finely chopped
1 small carrot, grated
250g turkey mince
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon dried cumin
1 tablespoon tomato purée
wholemeal breadcrumbs (from 1 slice of bread)
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten
To serve
4 tablespoons zero-fat Greek-style yoghurt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
2 medium tomatoes, sliced
1 red onion, sliced
2 teaspoons olive oil
pinch of black pepper

Method
Mix together the onion, carrot, mince, garlic, cumin, tomato purée, breadcrumbs and egg yolk.
Information:
Make leftover bread into breadcrumbs and store in the freezer.
Divide the mixture into 8 pieces, then form a sausage shape with each piece and wrap around a skewer.
Information:
If you prefer, form the mixture into 16 small balls and cook either on skewers or individually.
Put the koftas in a foil-lined grill pan and put under a preheated grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, prepare the dip by combining the yoghurt and mint. For the salad, layer the sliced tomatoes and onions, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper.
Information:
These koftas could also be served hot with vegetables, boiled rice and the minty yoghurt.
