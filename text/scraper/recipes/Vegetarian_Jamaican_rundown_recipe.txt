Seasoning tip
Always taste your food before adding salt – eating too much salt can increase blood pressure.

Method
Add 4 sprays of oil to a large non-stick pot on low heat. Add the onions, garlic and thyme, and sauté on low heat for 30 seconds.
Stir in all-spice powder and curry powder, and gently cook for 1 minute.
Stir in all the remaining vegetables and kidney beans, cook on medium heat for 60 seconds, then pour in the coconut milk. Stir well.
Information:
For some spiciness, add a halved scotch bonnet pepper along with the rest of the veg, then remove along with the thyme before serving.
Cover the pot and bring to the boil, then gently simmer on low heat for 15 to 20 minutes.
Add salt (if using) and pepper, stir and simmer for another 5 minutes, until the veg is has softened and cooked through. Remove the thyme sprigs and serve with a small (75g) portion of steamed brown basmati rice.
