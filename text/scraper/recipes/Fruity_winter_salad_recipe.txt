100g lower-fat soft cheese

Method
Put the cabbage into a large salad bowl. Add the red onion, carrot, apple, lemon juice and sultanas (raisins would also do).
Information:
If you like, add two satsumas, broken into segments, or use a can of mandarin oranges in natural juice, well drained.
To make the dressing, put the soft cheese into a bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until softened.
Information:
For extra flavour, choose a lower-fat soft cheese with garlic and herbs.
Add the yoghurt and mix together. Pour over the salad, season with some black pepper and toss to mix. Serve.

For a more filling lunch, try with a wholemeal bread roll.
