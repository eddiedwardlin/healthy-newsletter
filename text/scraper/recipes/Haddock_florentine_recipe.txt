Ingredients
4 skinless haddock fillets
4 tomatoes, halved
4 eggs
4 slices wholemeal bread
4 teaspoons reduced-fat spread
300g spinach
1 pinch ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the grill. Fill the kettle and boil it. Grill the haddock fillets, with the tomatoes at the side of the grill pan for 5 to 6 minutes until the fish is cooked (it should stop looking see-through and should flake easily).
Information:
For a treat, try salmon instead of haddock.
Meanwhile, poach the eggs in gently simmering water for 4 to 5 minutes. Toast the slices of bread and spread them with reduced-fat spread.
Information:
Adding a shake of vinegar to the poaching water helps the eggs to keep together.
Put the spinach in a large colander and slowly pour the kettleful of boiling water over the leaves to wilt them. Leave to drain for a few moments, then share between 4 warm plates. Arrange the fish on top, and place a poached egg onto each portion.
Information:
Serve with grilled mushrooms instead of spinach, if you prefer.
Sprinkle with black pepper and serve with the tomatoes and toast.
